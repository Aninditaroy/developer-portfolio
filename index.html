            <h3>Singer and Princess</h3>
            <p>Phoebe is a sweet-natured but odd guitar player. Having experienced nothing like a normal, complete
                childhood, Phoebe is often very dim-witted, sometimes smart and is in some regards still a child at
                heart. She believed Santa Claus existed, until Joey told her otherwise. Phoebe also shocks some people
                in the story line with her frankness on occasions that it catches them off guard from her usual self.
                This straightforwardness is a running gag throughout the Friends series.</p>
