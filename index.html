            <h3>Singer and Weirdo</h3>
            <p>Phoebe is a sweet-natured but odd guitar player. Having experienced nothing like a normal, complete
                childhood, Phoebe is often very dim-witted, sometimes smart and is in some regards still a child at
                heart. She believed Santa Claus existed, until Joey told her otherwise. Phoebe also shocks some people
                in the story line with her frankness on occasions that it catches them off guard from her usual self.
                This straightforwardness is a running gag throughout the Friends series.</p>

                <p>Phoebe's music is often different from conventional music. She describes her musical style as "acoustic folksy stuff" in "The One With The Pediatrician". She often sings out of key, showing little actual singing talent, but this is one of the reasons she is a beloved character. She has shown, however, to be a creative and unique songwriter. Her songs include the famous "Smelly Cat", which became both a jingle for a kitty litter television commercial.</p>

                <p>Other tunes include "The Grandma Song" (a song about grandparent death) and "The Cow in the Meadow goes Moo" (a song about meat production and packaging), both of which she sang to the children in the public library program. Her honest lyrics earned her the nickname "The Lady Who Sings About the Truth". She also sang a song called "Happy Birthday, Emma" in Season 10, on the occasion of the birthday of Rachel and Ross' daughter Emma.</p>
